# Description
This project is an example of a school portal where students can register, login, and enroll in classes. This project was built using the Python web framework Flask for the backend, Bootstrap4 and simple CSS for the frontend, and a MongoDB database to store all the student and course information. I also used Jinja2 for templating and flask-security for some simple information security.


# API
This project also feautures a REST API that was made using the Flask extenstion, flask-restplus. It retrieves the information of all the registered students such as the student id, email, and name. The API was also tested by using Postman.
